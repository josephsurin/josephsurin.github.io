This decision was both a blessing and a curse. We had overwhelmingly positive feedback for our support effort this year. We had almost 24/7 support available (shoutout to the night shift crew) and the ticket system made it easy for all of the admins to help out and see what issues people were having.

At times I felt really overwhelmed by the amount of people DMing me and requesting my support in tickets and I felt bad that it took so long to respond to them. In my opinion, there were a lot of unnecessary support requests for things like flag format for some challenges which isn't a fault on the support system or player's part, but something we probably should have considered beforehand. For the most part, players were very understanding and respectful which I am quite grateful for.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The scoreboard was interesting to watch, first bloods went a bit slower than I was expecting but that might have been a timezone thing as the solve counts started to make more sense during the second day of the CTF. Players might have also noticed the eligibility scoreboards at the start of the CTF which wasn't really working for the first day. We didn't plan to have it until 2 hours before the CTF started so we quickly put together a script to generate the scoreboard but there were a few infra hiccups with that. Since it wasn't the biggest priority for the time being, it wasn't that stressful, but the infra team managed to fix it up to get a few updates going towards the end of the CTF. It was intense to watch the Swinburne team and the UWA team fight for 2nd place and the UNSW team against the UQ team in the womens category. Blitzkrieg, which consisted of mostly high school students ended up taking the top place in the eligibility bracket winning very comfortably. Pretty impressive, but not exactly surprising if you know who they are.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The duration of the CTF felt a bit long. I am usually not a fan of CTFs that go for longer than 36 hours because it's just very tiring. I didn't get a lot of sleep on the first night because I felt bad for the night shift crew and the tickets just wouldn't stop flowing. That said, I think it's a tradeoff and 48 hours worked well for most people; especially beginners and dedicated competitors who planned to clear their weekend for the CTF. It allowed us to write a lot of challenges spanning a variety of categories and difficulties meaning there would be something for everyone to have fun with.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In the last 2 hours of the CTF there was a debacle with a troll appearing out of nowhere, submitting almost all the flags, reaching 3rd place in a couple minutes, threatening to leak flags, and actually leaking a flag in the Discord. We dealt with them and banned them quickly and kept a close eye on everything for the last 2 hours. They taunted us with messages in the CTFd submissions and caused us quite a lot of stress. They had pretty good opsec and we couldn't exactly figure out who was behind it but after we banned them they seemed to have gone silent and were quickly forgotten about. I was really confused by this; I'm pretty confident it wasn't just one person because there's no way they would have legitimately solved all of those challenges in 46 hours by themselves, and the motive is pretty unclear too. If it was just one person, we'd suspect they pwned us, but if they did they'd have a lot more power than just the flags. If they somehow had access to our private GitHub repo they should've had all the flags but they didn't submit the flag for Substitution Cipher III so we kinda ruled that possibility out as well. We (jokingly) entertained this idea for a bit thinking it was an inside job, it was like a real life game of among us, kinda funny actually. At the end of all of this, I'm still confused and disappointed. It's a shame that people would try to ruin a competition run by volunteers that does nothing but good for the community. If there's something you aren't happy about for whatever reason we are very open to feedback; there's no reason to be so childish and ruin it for everyone else.\"), mdx(\"h1\", null, \"Challenges\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I wrote 7 crypto challenges, 7 rev challenges, and 3 pwn challenges.
